# Data-Structures-I
C programs dealing with simple data structures.  Includes backups of original .c files. Projects include creation and manipulation of data structures such as queues and linked lists.  
<br></br>Galaga V1 uses arrays of linked lists and linked lists of arrays to map out a playing field for a user to enjoy a simple version of Galaga exclusively using the C language.  This was a project that I worked on to flesh out the topics that I was taught in lecture.
